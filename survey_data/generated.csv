While well intentioned perhaps, it can inadvertently disadvantage, discriminate and penalise minority ethnicities, who may struggle to buy/sell flats as a result of the ethnic quota. Still, I acknowledge it's meant to foster greater multiethnic interaction and harmony, and prevent a certain block/neighbourhood/town from being dominated by a certain group and Singaporeans splitting into ethnic enclaves, so I'm also not 100% sure what the alternative would be. ","Even though I understand the positive intentions behind EIP, it also seems like a somewhat artificial, contributed and forced form of ""diversity"" that is imposed on us. Perhaps the true harmony and diversity can only be achieved if we allow it to form naturally and organically, rather than by using a mandatory law or regulatory policy. Sure, it will be hard, but that's the ideal."
